This dissertation reports on the search for
the \gls{VBS} in semileptonic channel \textit{ZV},
where the \textit{Z} boson decays to a pair of leptons (electrons or muons),
and the other vector boson \textit{V} (either \textit{W} or \textit{Z})
decays hadronically to a pair of jets, in association of two jets
i.e.~\( \textit{ZV}jj \rightarrow l^{+}l^-jjjj \), \( l=e \) or \( \mu \).
The search used 137 \fbinv{} of proton-proton collision data collected by
the \gls{CMS} experiment at the \gls{LHC} with
center-of-mass energy (\( \sqrt{s} \)) of 13 \TeV{} from 2016 to 2018.
\gls{VBS} is a key process in understanding the nature of \gls{EWSB} in
the framework of \gls{SM}.

Studies and instrumentation done towards the future detector
upgrade to the \gls{CMS} experiment which will replace
the current endcap \gls{HCAL} and \gls{ECAL} with \gls{HGCAL}
during \gls{LS3} are also reported.
Optimal configuration
of scintillator tiles coupled to \glspl{SiPM}
in the \gls{HGCAL} is measured and suggested using testbeam measurement of
scintillator tiles and noise measurement of \glspl{SiPM}.
Prototyping of automated wrapping of scintillator tiles in \gls{ESR} film
are also discussed.
