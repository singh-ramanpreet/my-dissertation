  Analysis Code
 }


Analysis code used for the analysis is hosted on
Github (\url{https://github.com}) platform.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Custom NanoAOD production from MiniAOD
        to include missing \gls{PDF} weights.

        \url{https://github.com/singh-ramanpreet/VBS-customNanoAODProduction/}

  \item ``NanoSkim'': Intermediate skimming step for the analysis
        phase space with minimal selection to save time,
        when run it again during analysis development.

  \item ``Selection'': This repo contains the code for main event
        selection of this analysis, it also calculates and embed scale factors
        for various objects.

  \item ``Analysis'': This repo contains code \gls{MVA} training,
        \gls{MVA} inference and embedding, making Data/MC histograms,
        making datacards for the statistical analysis with \texttt{CombineLimit}.
