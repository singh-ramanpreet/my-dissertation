  Summary

In this dissertation the related contribution; the
development of \gls{SM} \gls{VBS}
analysis in semileptonic \textit{ZVjj} channel, and
the development and instrumentation of the upgraded endcap calorimeter
\gls{HGCAL} for the \gls{CMS} experiment are discussed.
Measurement of the \gls{VBS} is a key to understanding the nature of \gls{EWSB} at the \TeV{} scale.
EW VBS is a rare process (\(O(\alpha_{EW}^{6})\)).
Higher integrated luminosity and HGCAL upgrade will improve the signal sensitivities of VBS like searches.

This \gls{SM} \gls{VBS} analysis is done with the 137 \fbinv{} of integrated luminosity data
using 13\TeV{} proton-proton collision
dataset collected by the \gls{CMS} experiment during the 2016 to 2018 run period.
To correct
and normalize DY plus jets background model, a control region
defined using hadronic boson mass was used.
\gls{MVA} approach was used to
model signal versus background classifier using gradient boosted
\gls{BDT} in the signal region.
Expected significance of \( ~1.5\sigma \) is reported for
\gls{EW} \gls{VBS} \textit{ZVjj}.

The \gls{HGCAL} in addition to replacing dying \gls{ECAL} and \gls{HCAL}
hardware, will also enhance many \gls{VBS} analysis,
since the jets in endcap suffers the most from pileup
contamination. Reconstructing narrow jets
using the lateral and longitudinal granularity of the silicon and scintillator cells,
can significantly increase the physis sensitivity of the \gls{CMS} data.
\gls{HGCAL} is expected to be installed
during \gls{LS3} which is currently scheduled to be from end of year 2025
to the start of year 2029. Simulation and instrumentation studies,
critical to the configuration and assembly of the scintillator part of
the \gls{HGCAL} are reported on.

In Chapter~\ref{ch_hgcal} of this dissertation, optimal configuration
of scintillator tiles coupled with \glspl{SiPM}
were studied and suggested by simulating end-of-life scenarios
of the \gls{HGCAL}. Results made use of testbeam measurement of
the scintillator tiles conducted by \gls{FNAL}
and the cold noise measurement of \glspl{SiPM}.
